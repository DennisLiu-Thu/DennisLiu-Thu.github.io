Emerging Mixed Reality (MR) platforms with spatially aware capabilities allow us to experience digital objects blended with the real world, yet current HCI researches neglect the rich potential that olfactory inputs hold for enhancing user immersion and interaction within immersive MR environments. Additionally, the interaction between olfactory rendering and the physical environment has not been thoroughly investigated.   
We proposed a **"field-centric"** olfactory rendering strategy, designed and implemented the **AroMR** proof-of-concept prototype, and explored potential olfactory scenarios and design spaces within Mixed Reality.

## “Flied-Centric”  

Unlike traditional olfactory devices placed near the nose, the "field-centric" strategy disperses small olfactory units across various locations in the physical environment. Users can fully leverage the physical space to create a "scent network" and better utilize the airflow within the environment to interact with the scents emitted by the devices. This approach enables effects such as dispersion, flow, and wafting, which are difficult to achieve with conventional olfactory devices.
