Unlike traditional olfactory devices placed near the nose, the "field-centric" strategy disperses small olfactory units across various locations in the physical environment. Users can fully leverage the physical space to create a "scent network" and better utilize the airflow within the environment to interact with the scents emitted by the devices. This approach enables effects such as dispersion, flow, and wafting, which are difficult to achieve with conventional olfactory devices.
